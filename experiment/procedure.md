<b>Procedure – </b>
1. Ensure the complete opened position of delivery valve. <br>
2. Measure height of the pressure gauge above the vacuum gauge.<br>
3. Switch on the pump.<br>
4. Vary the flow rate (discharge) by closing the delivery valve.<br>
5. Adjust the delivery valve accordingly the pressure gauge reading of 1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>.<br>
6. Note down vacuum gauges reading. <br>
7. Note down time taken for ‘h’ cm rise of oil (10 cm) in collecting tank. <br>
8. Note down the time taken for ‘n’ revolutions for energy meter disc (3 rev). <br>
9. Repeat the procedure for 1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> incremental by closing the delivery valve gradually, (i.e. 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>).<br>
10. Switch off the power supply after opening the delivery valve completely.<br><br>
