<b>Procedure – </b>
1. Ensure the complete opened position of delivery valve. <br>
2. Measure height of the pressure gauge above the vacuum gauge.<br>
3. Switch on the pump.<br>
4. Vary the flow rate (discharge) by closing the delivery valve.<br>
5. Adjust the delivery valve accordingly the pressure gauge reading of 1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>.<br>
6. Note down vacuum gauges reading. <br>
7. Note down time taken for ‘h’ cm rise of oil (10 cm) in collecting tank. <br>
8. Note down the time taken for ‘n’ revolutions for energy meter disc (3 rev). <br>
9. Repeat the procedure for 1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> incremental by closing the delivery valve gradually, (i.e. 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>).<br>
10. Switch off the power supply after opening the delivery valve completely.<br><br>

<b>Formulae – <b><br>
1. Total Head, H=[P + (V)/760] × 10<sup>5<sup>/ρg+Z <br>
Where, P = Pressure gauge reading in Kg/cm<sup>2<sup> <br>
V = Vacuum gauge reading in mm of Hg <br>
For V, 1 mm of Hg/760 = 1 bar <br>
For P  1 bar = 1 Kg/cm<sup>2<sup> <br><br>

2. Discharge, Q=((A×h)/t) <br>
A = area of the collecting tank in m<sup>2<sup> <br>
h = rise of oil level taken in meters (say 0.1 m or 10 cm) <br>
t = time taken for rise of water level to height ‘R’ in seconds <br><br>

3. Output in Watts, OP=  (ρ×g×Q×H)/1000 <br>
ρ = density of oil = 860 Kg/m<sup>3<sup> <br>
g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/s<sup>2<sup> <br><br>

4. Output in Kw, IP=  (n×3600×η<sub>m<sub>)/(E<sub>c<sub> ×T) <br>
n = number of revolutions taken in energy meter = 3 <br>
η<sub>m<sub> = efficiency of motor = 0.80 <br>
E<sub>c<sub> = energy meter constant in Rev /kWh = 1200 Rev / kWh <br>
T = time required to complete n revolution in sec <br><br>

5.  Efficiency, η=  OP/IP × 100 <br><br>


<b>Observations –</b><br>
1. Measuring Area in collecting tank = 0.3 x 0.3 m<sup>2</sup>  <br>   	  
2. Datum head, Z = 0.3 m <br>
3. Density of oil, ρ = 860 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br>
4. Energy meter constant in Rev /kWh, E<sup>c</sup> = 1200 Rev / kWh<br>
5. Efficiency of motor, η<sup>m</sup>  = 0.80<br>
6. Number of revolutions taken in energy meter, n = 3<br>
