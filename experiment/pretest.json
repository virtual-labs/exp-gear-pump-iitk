      "explanations": {
        "a": "The correct answer is “meshing of gears”. A gear pump operates using the interlocking of gears to move fluid. As the gears rotate, they create a vacuum that draws fluid into the pump and then displaces it by the meshing of the gears, pushing it out through the outlet.",
